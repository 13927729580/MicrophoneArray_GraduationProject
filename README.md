# MicrophoneArray_GraduationProject

This is the Matlab and Python files of my gratudation project for my Bachelor diploma.

Based on the particularity of the microphone array, combined with the so-called *DOA-TDOA* model and the *GCC* algorithm as well as the comparison with the *beamforming* algorithm, after having grasped some knowledges of the *beamforming* technology, I designed a linear and equispaced array system which can estimate the location of a sound source in a 2-dimension space.

The Matlab program implements the *DOA-TDOA* model and simulates both the *GCC* algorithm and the *beamforming* algorithm. The Python program implements the *DOA-TDOA* model and **only** the *beamforming* algorithm.

PS: The Matlab files is named *by the date*.
